# Project MOI

MOI i.e., Moment Of Inertia is the quantity expressed by the body resisting angular acceleration, which is the sum of the product of the mass of every particle with its square of the distance from the axis of rotation. The moment of inertia is also known as the angular mass or rotational inertia. The SI unit of moment of inertia is kg m².

In this project we have made a calculator of calculating MOI of different regular shapes with and without circular cavity provided the centroidal point should be the same as that of the regular shapes.

So, here is the summary of the regular shapes of which the MOI has been calculated :

● Regular Shapes without any cavity :  
   &emsp;&emsp; ○ Rectangle  
   &emsp;&emsp;  ○ Triangle  
   &emsp;&emsp;  ○ Circle  
   &emsp;&emsp;  ○ Trapezoid  
   &emsp;&emsp;  ○ Semi-Circle  
   
● Regular Shapes with circular cavity having the same centroidal point as that of the regular shapes :  
   &emsp;&emsp; ○ Rectangle  
   &emsp;&emsp;  ○ Triangle  
   &emsp;&emsp;  ○ Circle  
   &emsp;&emsp;  ○ Trapezoid  
   &emsp;&emsp;  ○ Semi-Circle
    
Hope this code helps you for calculating the MOI of the above mentioned shapes.

Feel free to change the code.
